Git + Github

Workflow:
do some changes to file

> git add -A # adds all changed files to index
> git commit -m "message" #commits all files in index
> git push <remote> <branch>

(working directory is now clean)

Branches:
	> git branch # shows us available branches and active branch
	> git checkout <branch name> # switch to branch
		git checkout -b <new branch name>

Merging
	Applying the changes in one branch to another branch
	Source branch --> Target Branch

	> git checkout <target branch>
	> git merge <source branch> # merge changes from source branch

	> Git rmeote add orgin <url> # add the specified url as a remote reposidtory and name it 'origin'
	> git push origin <remote> <branch> # push the local commits to the remote called origin, specifically, the master branch
